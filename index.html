                    Hi! I'm <span class="emphasis">Tanaya</span>, a student at the <span class="emphasis">University of Maryland</span> who aspires to be a data scientist in the future. I am majoring in computer science and psychology, and hope to one day build a career where I can use both majors. Here's a link to <a href="http://www.google.com">my resume</a>.

                    Education and Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went to Poolesville high school in the Science, Math, and Computer Science program where I learned to build robots with arduinos, learn basic data strctures, and get introduced to <span class="emphasis">Java and Python</span>. I took a math-heavy courseload that included <span class="emphasis">AP Statistics</span> and <span class="emphasis">Calculus A/B</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In college, I took <span class="emphasis">Object-Oriented Programming</span> where I learned Java in depth, and <span class="emphasis">Computer Systems</span> which taught me how computer work at a low-level with the C programming language. I also was able to dabble in data science with classes such as <span class="emphasis">Statistics</span>, <span class="emphasis">Introduction to Data Science with Python</span>, and <span class="emphasis">Linear Algebra</span>.

                <p>
                    In my free time, I love to draw, watch youtube videos, play league of legends, and go to the gym! Exploring new places, getting to know new people, and trying new experiences is something that makes me really excited and I hope to travel a lot at some point in my life.
                    I am also passionate about neuroscience and love to read books and research on different topics related to our brains and how it works.
